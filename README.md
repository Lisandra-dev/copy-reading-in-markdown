# Copy Reading In Markdown

Copy a selection in reading view while keeping the markdown formatting

## ⚙️ Usage

- Select the text you want to copy
- Open the command palette
- Select `Copy Reading In Markdown`

> **Note**  
> It is possible that the command doesn't work on mobile, as the use of command palette unselects the text.

## 📝 Limitations

- Callout blocks are not supported (they are copied as blockquote)
- For a strange reason, the first line of a blockquote (only that is selected) is not copied as a blockquote. If you select the line before, they are... Same if the line is "empty" (or use invisible characters like `$~~$`).
- Marks are not supported
- Tables are not supported
- Footnotes are... Strange. They are copied as links, not the content of the footnote.
